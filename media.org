* Media I've consumed
Well, someone has said, that in this world there are people for
everything, or "it takes all sorts to make a world", so there must be
someone interested on the media I consume and what I think about
it. So here are music albums, movies and similar.

As i'm not a professional rater, I'm not gonna rate them, in numbers,
i'll just say what I think about the thing and that's it.

** Movies
- *Pulp Fiction (1994)*: The movie is stupid, ridicolous and most
  pejorative adjectives you can think of. But it's my favorite movie
  nevertheless.
- *Trainspotting (1996)*: Movie about Scottish Drugaddicts. The thing
  sends a Good Message. And the movie is really enjoyable.
- *T2 Trainspotting (2017)*: Not as good as the original but still
  passable.
- *Ghost in the Shell (1995)*: It's the only anime movie i've
  watched. It's pretty cyberpunk so i like it.
- *Torrente: El brazo tonto de la ley (1997)*: Fucking funny garbage, if
  i wasn't high i wouldn't have liked the thing.
- *Torrente 2: Misión en Marbella*: Idem
- *El día de la Bestia (1995)*: My favorite movie this country has made
- *Acción mutante (1993)*: One of the movies i laughed the most
- *Fear and loathing in Las Vegas (1998)*: I don't know what I watched
** Anime
I'm not much of an anime watcher, but eh, sure.

- *Serial Experiments Lain*: The anime is cool. I used to simp for Lain
  but then I discovered I'm qorg11, not a insecure, twitter user
- *Paranoia Agent*: I remember once a linguistics teacher I had told me
  to watch this anime. I watched it and I really enjoyed it. A good
  satire. I have keked big to this one.
- *Texhnolyze*: Made by the same guys that made Lain. But i enjoyed this
  one more than Lain
- *Haibane Renmei*: Made by the same guy as Lain and Texhnolyze, this is
  the only media that made me cry and i have 0 problems admiting it.

** Books
I know how to read

- *Neuromancer (1984)*: A drugaddict hacker needs to make money but he
  can't work because he stole from his bosses.

     

** Music

This shit will never be complete.

- *Iron Maiden - Somewhere in time* My favorite album from these
  dudes
- *Arpaviejas - Ladrón de Almas*: One of the best punk albums in
  Spanish
- *Eskorbuto - Anti todo* Idem
- *Living Death - World neuroses* It's alright
- *D.R.I. - Thrash zone* Cool
- *D.R.I. - Crossover* All songs are the same to be honest
- *death's dynamic shroud.wmv - I'll try living like this*: I've
  listened to this album high on different substances, each time was
  different, i love this album.
- *El Último ke zierre - Ay, de mi!:* Good album
- *El Último ke zierre - quemaste tus alas de angel:* Album de matao,
  pero está bien.
