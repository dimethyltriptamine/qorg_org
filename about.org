machine, with tildes available). And I have a [[https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#details/A16933881734FBAD4535EF0A7331F2120E5E9EBB][Tor node]]

** Languages
My native language is Spanish, and i am fluent in English, So you can
talk to me in any of these languages. I also have a bit of knowledge
of Esperanto but I forgot most of them. I would also like to learn
Catalan and Euskera, but i am too lazy for that.

** Politics
I used to care about them, I don't anymore, I just want freedom and
well being for everyone. And i'm not going to label this.

** Computing

My main machine is a ThinkPad x220. After using a ThinkPad T400 for a
long (long) time i decided it was time to upgrade. Not because
>core2duo. I have enough patience to wait 2 seconds for something to
load. RAM wasn't a problem either because i never use more than 3
gigs. I was having some hardware problems which were impossible to
debug. It had something to do with the GPU I believe, so everything i
would have to do is to change the CPU, but i couldn't find anything so
i just bought a x220. I already corebooted it and used the me_cleaner
thing, mind you.

I do most of my computing under a terminal, in which I run tmux, the
first frame is sshing to my server (A thinkpad T60 in less than 2
meters from me) in which i run this websites and most of my services
in. I ssh to this to, besides managing the server itself, run weechat
to use irc and more. In the second frame I runprofanity (XMPP client)
and in the third frame cmus, my music player.

My web browser is Pale Moon, which is garbage and i wish i had an
alternative, but it's the least bad thing out there.
